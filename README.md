# Scripts for Glyphs
These are some sample scripts and the necessary files to use Robofab scripts from within Glyphs.
Copy the files to the Glyphs Scripts folder. To navigate there quickly, choose Open Scripts Folder from the Scripts menu.
Feel free to organize files in subfolders.

#### Robofab 
To be able to use [Robofab](http://robofab.com) scripts, you need to put the file `objectsGS.py` and `GSPen.py` directly in the Script folder.

#### Data exchange with FontLab
Only the two files `Glyphs Export.py`, `Glyphs Import.py` need to go to the FontLab Macros Folder:
`~/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/`
Copy the path, and in Finder, press cmd+shift+G and paste the path.
